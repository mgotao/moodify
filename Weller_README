+ Connect to Spotify API


For this I wanted to get the app running and connected to Spotify, but I'm currently having trouble with API authorization. 
I'm relatively sure all I have to do is figure out how to get my app's SHA1 key, but there were also some issues with the redirect uri.
In the next day or so I want to get the app fully connected and get the media player up and running
