# Test Environment
  The purpose of the Test Environment is to showcase the backend that runs the track search of the Moodify application. The source code was written in Java 1.9, and developed using the IntelliJ IDE. The only external library used was the Gson library as Java does not have a built-in Json library. If run in IntelliJ, users should only need to hit run. Otherwise, the main file, testconnection.java, can be compiled with javac while including the Gson jar file, and run with Java.
