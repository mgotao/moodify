# Test Environment
  The purpose of the Test Environment is to showcase the backend that runs the track search of the Moodify application. The source code was
  written in Java 1.9, and developed in IntelliJ. The project pulls from the GSON library via the available jar file, so the project can
  be run outside of IntelliJ, assuming Gson is installed on the user's device.
